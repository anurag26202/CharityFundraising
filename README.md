## Vision

The Charity Fundraising Smart Contract is a decentralized platform for managing fundraising campaigns. It allows individuals or organizations to create campaigns, receive donations, and withdraw funds once a fundraising goal is met. This contract aims to streamline the process of raising and managing charitable funds while ensuring transparency and trust between donors and campaign creators.
